 from "FGC mission 8 ORTHO 1" scene and then paste in scenes so that you don't

- what a great idea of slowering the speed powerup now player have to deicde
  whether or not to pick it up becuse it slows speed every time hindering the
  jumping length.
  ( we know that speed increases on completeing speed milestones so no need
    to make a powerup to increse the speed )


-----the level works fine-----
